# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on redesigning the Introvirght website to look more professional and less AI-generated by taking inspiration from real, successful online platforms. The current design relies heavily on gradients, colorful themes, and animated effects that create an artificial appearance. The redesign will implement modern, clean design principles used by professional websites while maintaining the platform's core identity as a mindful social space.
