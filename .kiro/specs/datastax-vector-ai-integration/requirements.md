# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates DataStax Astra DB vector store with the AI companion to enable semantic search, personalized insights, and intelligent diary analysis. The system will store diary entries as vector embeddings and use them to provide contextual AI responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my diary entries to be semantically searchable, so that I can find relevant past entries based on meaning rather than just keywords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a diary entry THEN the system SHALL generate vector embeddings and store them in DataStax
2. WHEN a user searches their diary THEN the system SHALL return semantically similar entries
3. WHEN a user queries with natural language THEN the system SHALL find relevant entries based on meaning
4. IF the vector store is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to basic text search

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI companion to reference my past diary entries, so that it can provide personalized and contextual responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chats with the AI companion THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant diary context using vector similarity
2. WHEN the AI responds THEN it SHALL incorporate insights from similar past entries
3. WHEN providing advice THEN the AI SHALL reference the user's historical patterns and experiences
4. IF no relevant context is found THEN the AI SHALL provide general guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to discover patterns and insights in my diary entries, so that I can better understand my thoughts and emotions over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests insights THEN the system SHALL analyze vector clusters to identify themes
2. WHEN patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL present them in an understandable format
3. WHEN mood trends are identified THEN the system SHALL visualize emotional patterns over time
4. IF insufficient data exists THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest continued journaling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and private, so that my personal diary entries remain confidential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing vectors THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data
2. WHEN accessing DataStax THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication
3. WHEN a user deletes an entry THEN the system SHALL remove both the entry and its vectors
4. IF there's a security breach THEN the system SHALL have audit logs for investigation
